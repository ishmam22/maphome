Our yhack project 2016,

We have design a web site application to get information from arcgis mapping services and implement it in a real estate market of investment. By collecting and manipulating the data provided by arcgis we were able to creat a webmap that had some information that we judge were important to making a decision prior to investing into a property.

these factors where mainly the following ones:
  -Pollution
  -Proximity to Parcs and green area
  -Crime activity
  -Proximity to schools

With all this information on one map, we can observe and analyse an index that we came up with to evaluate to risk value of the sector in question.

This web app was build from the grown up to encourage people to get information but also to put to test their pre consive thoughts about there possible estate or properties. A section is disignated to evaluat the and inform the web site visitor to see if he should invest.
